<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Problem Statement</strong></span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponder is a platform for sharing your thoughts, or promoting some personal stuff and everything. Not only that it is also a very good place to check to keep yourself with what is happening around the world. But it has a very strict posting policy, and getting credits for good comments are really. Youâ€™re someone who has just started to use Ponder as a new user, you want to predict whether your comment is going to receive a good score or not.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Description</strong></span></h2>

<p>Train Having 45000 comment replies and the test set having 30000 rows of comments.Here Task was to build a model that can predict scores of comments present in the test dataset.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column Label</th>
    <th>Column Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>UID</td>
    <td>Unique Id</td>

<figure><img src="/images/commentScorer/CommentScorerDiagram.png" align = "middle"> <figcaption style = "font-size:15px;"></figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Workflow pipeline is as follow:
<ul>
<li>Used tfidf vectorization for both word and character level to convert the comments into vector form.</li>
<li>Generate new features like comment length,sentiment value of comment & profanity value of comment.</li>
<li>Concatenate both and apply the lightgbmRegressor model for 6 folds to get the final prediction.</li>
<li>lighgbmRegressor was tuned using the bayesian optimization.</li>
</ul>
