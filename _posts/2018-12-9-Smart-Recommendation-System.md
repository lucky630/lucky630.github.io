Last week i went for my first 24 Hour's offline hackathon.
This hackathon was organized by the company named Rakuten(who is also official sponsor of Barcelona Football team).
The teams come for this hackathon were selected based upon there idea's which were submitted during Hackerearth or Techgig online hackathon.

so i'm writing about the idea which we have submitted and the part which were implemented during this 1 day hackathon.
So let's start by introducing the idea.

our idea were to create a smart recommendation System which can combine with both Image and Text Search.This implemented Image Search feature was a miniature version of the Amazon's newly implemented Product Image search feature.

So, by combining Object Detection & Image segmentation with Hybrid Recommendation we can personalize the search result for each user.
